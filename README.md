## Stripped version of emacs.exe for Windows

I needed a smaller version of emacs.exe that I could use for scripting (with --batch) and the precompiled file is around 130 MB. This is a stripped version of the official binary that is only 30 MB. Get the files in the bin directory. The original file was downloaded from here: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-26/
